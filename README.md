software engineering course - java oop - 094219

  We will solve the hw for software engineer - הנדסת תוכנה course here (solve in IDE intelj and upload here via "commit/push" command). 

  - main branch will contain our **final** solutions - preferably in a folder named hw01, hw02... with the appropriate files

  - when your write your own code, make a new branch and have the name be "hw01_name" so that we can know who and what it is.

  - make sure to connect the github repo on intelj, copy the url of the repo: "https://github.com/GilCaplan/SE_course_Technion/tree/HW01_Amir" and when you       make changes on the IDE (intelj) you can commit them to github/local storage and that way we can keep track of our work. That way if there is an issue or     bug you can always go back a few steps.

lmk if you have any questions. 

We can also always meet in person to solve the hw or do it seperately and merge when done or pick one solution.
